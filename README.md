Import the new version of the deck.

Note that this will not delete cards that you have studied before, with the intention of retaining your progress on this card. You can either choose to delete it manually and have it replaced, or go into the card and edit it with the new changes to keep your progress.

## Grouping Units

You can create a empty deck called CS, and drag the individual unit decks into this.
Then, click CS to study all cards at the same time.

If you want to study certain decks (for example, because an upcoming test only contains 4 of 8 topics), create another empty deck.
Drag the units you want to study into this empty deck, open it and study.
Once finished, drag the units back to the main CS empty deck.

## A quick guide to Anki

Anki is a flashcard app designed to be used **in the long term**.
It is not meant to be used to cram before a test, instead building knowledge slowly over time.

- Again should be used if you got the answer completely wrong, or if it's the first time you're seeing the card.
- Hard and Good are self explanatory.
- Easy will bury the card for a few days or more. Use this only if it really was easy.

Click the cog icon next to any deck, and press Options.
It's not essential you know everything in here, but some options may be useful.
- New cards/day allows you to control how many unseen cards will be introduced every day.
- Maximum reviews/day shouls be set to max, to allow any pending reviews to be completed.

You can also use Custom Study to make temporary changes to study.
Press any deck. At the bottom of the screen, Custom Study will allow you to make changes.
Most useful is the "Increase today's new card limit," letting you see more new cards than usual in one day.
