## A quick guide to Anki

Anki is a flashcard app designed to be used **in the long term**.
It is not meant to be used to cram before a test, instead building knowledge slowly over time.

Again should be used if you got the answer completely wrong, or if it's the first time you're seeing the card.
Hard and Good are self explanatory.
Easy will bury the card for a few days or more. Use this only if it really was easy.
